🌐 Live Web App (Streamlit): https://employee-salary-classification-web-app.streamlit.app/
  

## ✨ Objective of the Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee earns more than $50K annually based on demographic and work-related features. The model is trained using the Adult Income dataset from the UCI repository. Features like age, education, occupation, hours-per-week, and others are used to make the prediction. The trained model is integrated into a user-friendly web application using streamlit, allowing real-time salary classification. This solution can be valuable for HR analytics and organizational workforce insights.


## ⚡ What I Built

An end-to-end **Streamlit-based ML application** featuring:

🔍 **Real-time salary prediction** using multiple ML models

🧼 **Complete data preprocessing** pipeline (cleaning, encoding, scaling)

📈 **Model evaluation:** accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred), classification_report(precision, recall, F1-score, support)

📊 **Box plots, Bar charts, Outlier detection**


## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

* Linear Regression
 
* Random Forest Classifier
  
* KNeighborsClassifier
  
* SVC (Support Vector Classifier) 
  
* GradientBoostingClassifier
  

## 📁 Dataset Info

* **Dataset Name**: ADULT.CSV

* **Source**: Kaggle

* **Size**: 500+ rows

* **Key Features**: age, workclass, fnlwgt, educational_num, marital_status, occupation, relationship, race,gender, capital_gain.....

* **Preprocessing**: Outlier removal, encoding, feature scaling


## 🗂️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: Streamlit (for building and deploying a web-based user interface)

* **Backend/ML:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

* **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Gradient Boosting

* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

* **Model Deployment:** Joblib (for saving the best model)
